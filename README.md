# AlogBox

Welcome to the DataStructuresAndAlgorithms library, a comprehensive, easy-to-use, and extensible collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C++.  
This library aims to provide an educational resource for learning about data structures and algorithms as well as a reliable toolkit for everyday programming.

## Features
Data Structures
- **Trees**: Various advanced tree data structures such as segment trees (for managing interval information) and balanced trees.
- **Graphs**: Convenient and easy-to-use graph data structure, offering algorithms for shortest paths and minimum spanning trees.
- **Strings**: Complex data structures for string processing, including the Aho-Corasick automaton and suffix automaton.
- **Others**: Some difficult-to-categorize but highly efficient data structures, such as the ODT (Order-statistic Tree) for managing interval assignments.  

Algorithms
- **Number Theory**: Common number theory operations used in computer science, such as prime generation and testing, extended Euclidean algorithm, etc.
- **Geometry**: Basic operations for points, lines, and polygons, including area calculations, convex hulls, etc.
- **Calculus**: Basic calculus functions, such as numerical integration and differentiation, used for scientific and engineering calculations.
- **Tools**
  We will also provide corresponding utility classes to facilitate the use of the library, such as locks to ensure thread safety.
